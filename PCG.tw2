You come across a small town with a busy town square. There is a small shop where you can purchase weapons and supplies for your journey. But first, you need to find out exactly where Bloomrane Cavern is located. Near the inn, some townsfolk are discussing the local news and gossip. There are several market stalls, including one for a cartographer. You also see two cloaked figures slip into an alleyway.
