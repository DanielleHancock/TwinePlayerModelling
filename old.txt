:: Welcome!
You are a brave adventurer, seeking fame and fortune by finding the lost gold of Bloomrane Cavern. Your first stop is the small town of Brekvern, where you hope to find information on how to reach the cave.

Before you is a fork in the road. Both paths lead to Brekvern and would have you arrive in roughly the same amount of time. Down one path, is a large ogre just ahead, guarding the way forward. Down the other, is a group of goblins a ways down the road, but headed in your direction.

Which path do you choose?

But first, you need to find out exactly where Bloomrane Cavern is located. Near the inn, some townsfolk are discussing the local news and gossip. There are several market stalls, including one for a cartographer. You also see two cloaked figures slip into an alleyway.

:: Choice 4
You exit the shop and begin following the road north toward the cavern. You remain alert, having heard rumors of a group of bandits living north of Brekvern. Eventually, the road narrows to a simple dirt path through the forest. Making your way through the forest, you come across a small campsite--several tents, crates and sacks of supplies, and a still-smouldering campfire--but no one seems to be around. Suddenly, you hear a woman's scream. "Help! Somebody help me!" Ah. You suppose you've located the bandits--and their campsite. The woman is clearly in need of rescue. On the other hand, you could take advantage of the outlaws' temporary absence and see whether they have any useful supplies you could "borrow."

You aim your bow and fire at one of the bandits, but the feeble arrow bounces off of his leather armor. The nearest bandit charges at you, swinging his sword,

"Oh, hello there! I didn't mean to intrude. I'm just a traveller passing through," you say cheerfully. The bandits don't seem convinced. You are standing in the middle of their camp, after all. They glare at you menacingly. "What do you think you're doing in our camp?" one says angrily, pointing his sword toward you.
