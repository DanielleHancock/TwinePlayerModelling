::Puzzle
You enter a clearing and see a tunnel in the side of the cliff face. The road passes through here and there doesn't seem to be any way around. As you approach, however, you see that the entrance to the cave is blocked by a large stone door with a face carved onto it. When you try to open the door, the face springs to life and the door speaks, "To enter the cavern and claim the treasure within, you must first answer my riddle."

With all of your strength, you thrust your sword into the gap where the two sides of the door meet. The door yelps in surprise, opening just a little. You quickly dive through the crack and find yourself inside Bloomrane Cavern. You hear a faint sigh and grumbling discontent on the other side of the door.

<<else>>
You strike the door with your sword, leaving the door unscathed but a large chip in your sword. "I'm made of stone. You're just going to ruin that sword." The door chides.

You fire several arrows at the door. "Ha! That tickles!" the door giggles. Determined, you continue firing. The door suddenly bursts open, laughing uncontrollably. You quickly dive through the crack and find yourself inside Bloomrane Cavern. The door manages to compose itself, and you hear a faint sigh and grumbling discontent behind you.

<<else>>
You fire arrow after arrow at the door to no effect. "Ha! That tickles!" The door laughs. You aren't sure if he's mocking you, or if that does actually tickle.

You charge a powerful spell and cast it at the door. "Ahh!" it yelps, seemingly out of surprise more than anything else. The door begins to open, reacting to your magic. "Wait, that's not supposed to happen!" the door shouts as the face is obscured from view, leaving a clear and open entryway into Bloomrane Cavern.

A gust of flame erupts from your hand and does absolutely nothing because this is a solid stone door. "Are you done? Did you get it all out of your system?" it asks.

You try to offer some of your treasure and items to the door. "I'm a stone door; what could you possibly offer me I would want?" it scoffs.

You try to offer some of your treasure and items to the door. "I'm a stone door. Why would I want anything you're offering me?," it scoffs. Desperate, you take off the ring you've been wearing. It's a family heiroom, passed down for generations, and your most precious possession. You've worn it every day for as long as you can remember. You plead your case to the door; it contemplates your offer. "Alright, fine. If you want to pass through that badly, I'll let you through."

Seeing as the door has already seen you, and as there is nothing large enough nearby to hide behind, you simply crouch down in the hopes that the door won't be able to see you anymore.

"I can still see you," the door says, exasperated. "What is it you hope to accomplish with this?"

As you try to sneak past, you realize that you can't. There is only one entrance and it is blocked by a very solid, very closed door. And the door can see you.

You look around and notice a crevice in the stone wall of the cliff. It looks just large enough for you to fit through. Turning sideways, you manage to squeeze through the gap.

You stay in the same position and wait. "Seriously, I can see you! I'm a door; I'm not going anywhere. I'm not even capable of leaving!" the door taunts. You continue to wait. Hours pass, the door growing increasingly frustrated, and seemingly, a bit tired. In one fateful moment, the door yawns, opening just a little, and you dive through the crack into the cavern beyond. You hear a faint sigh and grumbling discontent on the other side of the door.

You stay in the same position and wait.  "Seriously, I can see you! I'm a door; I'm not going anywhere. I'm not even capable of leaving!" the door taunts. Determined, you continue waiting. You lose track of time. Has it been minutes? Hours? Days? The door remains firmly closed. Eventually, you decide try a different approach.
