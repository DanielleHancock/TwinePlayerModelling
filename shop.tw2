:: Shop Welcome
"Hello!" The shopkeeper greets you warmly. "Welcome to my little shop. What can I interest you in today? A new weapon? Or perhaps a suit of armor?"

You look at the items for sale. There is a gleaming magic sword, a beautiful magic bow, and a tome of powerful magic spells. Each weapon costs 3 gold. There is also a set of steel armor, and some healing potions, each for 2 gold. A wooden sign on the wall informs you, "No Trades - Gold Only!"

\<<if $inventory["gold"] < 2 >>
Unfortunately, you don't have enough gold to buy anything.
